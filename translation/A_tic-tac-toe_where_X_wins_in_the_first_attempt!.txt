▶ A tic-tac-toe where X wins in the first attempt!

When we initialize row variable, this visualization explains what happens in the memory

And when the board is initialized by multiplying the row, this is what happens inside the memory (each of the elements board[0], board[1] and board[2] is a reference to the same list referred by row)

We can avoid this scenario here by not using row variable to generate board. (Asked in this issue).
